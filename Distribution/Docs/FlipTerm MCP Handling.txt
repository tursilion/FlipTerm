FlipTerm is Largely Compliant with the MCP 2.1 spec, although 
some responsibility is placed on the plug-ins to do their job
correctly. (See the plugin definition).

FlipTerm is very slightly more flexible regarding the initial
negotiation - FlipTerm will accept the initial MCP VERSION string
to initiate MCP handling up until the second line of data entered
by the user.

The purpose of this is to permit MCP negotiation to take place
through a program that runs after the user connects, rather than
before, which requires support in the Muck Server itself. The
program can be executed as one of the login programs, which will
successfully initiate MCP with the client.

In order to allow for the possibility that the user may make an
error entering their password, the connect command is explicitly
checked for and will reset the counter to 1. The purpose of 
disabling the MCP setup is to reduce the odds of spoofing a
MCP negotiation.

The MCP 2.1 spec specifies that the MCP version must be the
first thing that the server sends. This change permits it to
occur later. Note the limitations on the MUF program provided to
deal with this, however.

Once established, MCP commands receive very little parsing by
FlipTerm:

-Network Line translation - FlipTerm handles this fully
-Simple Message Format - FlipTerm handles verification of the 
	session key
-Multiline Message Format - FlipTerm passes to plugins directly
-Error Handling - FlipTerm displays notifications for certain 
	conditions
-Startup Sequence - FlipTerm handles entirely, querying plugins 
	for support
-Packages - FlipTerm handles mcp-negotiate 2.1 and mcp-cord 1.0 
	responses
-Cord messages - FlipTerm passes to plugins directly

Most of the work is performed within the plugins themselves. FlipTerm
will pass the complete string as it has received it to the plugin,
which must then indicate whether or not it has processed the string.
If it does not, Flipterm will offer the string to the next plugin, and
so forth.

FlipTerm follows these steps to process received probable MCP strings:
-Starts with #$" ? 
	- Strip off the #$" and proceed normally
-Does not start with #$# ?
	- Abort processing and proceed normally
-Starts with #$#* ? (multiline)
	- Send string to plugins
-Starts with #$#mcp-cord ? (cord function)
	- Send string to plugins
-Verify the session key. Is it incorrect?
	- Abort processing. Alert the user if 20 incorrect keys are 
	received this session.
-Send string to plugins. Ignore if not processed
