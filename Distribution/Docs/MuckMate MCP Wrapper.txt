MuckMate MCP Wrapper v1.0 - by Tursi
------------------------------------

MuckMate is a standalone external program created by Karna of MtakiSoft
that extends the standard text-based Muck experience by adding sounds,
music, and images WITHOUT any dependance on what muck client you choose
to use.

Under the standard MuckMate usage, the Mud Server contacts the client
directly when it wants to communicate information to MuckMate. MuckMate
then has enough information to go out and fetch the desired resource
itself.

This works well in most situations and provides the 100% independance
from the Mud client that the author was intending. You get the extra
features without having to switch clients.

There are two potential problems with this approach, however.

The first is almost entirely an administration issue. Players running
a personal firewall or otherwise monitoring connections to their machine
may be alarmed to see incoming connections being made to their system.
This is easily addressed so long as the Wizards of the muck make very
clear to their users that this will happen as a part of the MuckMate
extension. The port is well-defined and so can easily be watched for.

The second is the problem of players behind a NAT or other firewall that
prevents incoming connections from reaching their machine. Other than
the overkill of UPNP, or punching the port directly through the firewall,
there doesn't seem to be any solution.

MCP is a mechanism by which a 7-bit ASCII based Mud may send 'Out of band'
information to a client that supports it. This permits nearly anything
beyond text to be implemented, however, it is up to the client to provide
the necessary services. MCP is supported by the server FuzzBall 6, and by
the clients Trebuchet and FlipTerm. There may be others.

This wrapper attempts to provide a thin layer between MCP and MuckMate,
which permits adding a great number of features with very minimal client
support. The client must only understand enough MCP to send a command to
MuckMate. By moving the connection to MuckMate to the local client, the
firewall problems are also addressed.
