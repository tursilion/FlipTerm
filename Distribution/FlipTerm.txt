Welcome to FlipTerm!

FlipTerm is based on the GMud 1.7b code base, and all the original documentation
and source code is included with this distribution. If you don't care about source
code, feel free to delete the /src folder - it won't hurt anything!

This program is distributed under the terms of the original license, which states
that derived works may be distributed freely so long as they aren't taking full
credit, which I'm not. Please read the relevant documentation for the original
licensing. This software may not be sold, although reasonable media and copying
fees are fine so long as you offer me a free copy. ;)

The reason for this update was two-fold. First, I needed a client that had ALL
the features I wanted in one place, and I always liked GMud. So when I found the
source code, I got to work.

Second, FlipSide added support for enhanced graphics in the muck, and I needed a
terminal program to bolt my protocol to. You'll find a description of the extension
in another document. There's also a .DLL available in the source folder for use in
your own projects - please read the documentation available there.



----------------------
Command Line Interface
----------------------
Type /help. If you're the sort who would use this, that's all you need.

----------
KeyPresses
----------

Many shortcuts are available in FlipTerm.

CHANGE WINDOWS:
Control-Tab - next window
Alt-1, Alt-2, Alt-3, etc - Change directly to Window 1, 2, 3, etc (up to number 10 for '0')
(Control-1, etc, works now too.)

SCROLL SCREEN:
Page up and Page down

REVIEW COMMAND HISTORY:
Control P -or-   (p for Previous)
Control Up Arrow -or-
Alt Up Arrow -or-
Up Arrow (in single line entry mode) - Previous command

Control N -or-    (N for Next)
Control Down Arrow -or-
Alt Down Arrow -or-
Down Arrow (in single line entry mode) - Next command after going back

ERASE COMMAND WINDOW:
Control U -or-
Escape (Esc)

MOVEMENT KEYS ('MapKeys' must be enabled in the switches menu, and Num Lock
must be on)
Note: these keys are special in that they send the command immediately and
do not affect the command buffer (ie: you can move while in the middle of 
typing! ;) ) The following keys are on the numeric keypad.
7,8,9,4,6,1,2,3 - Compass directions (ie: NORTH, NORTHEAST, SOUTHWEST, etc)
5 - DOWN
0 - UP
The text will be sent in lowercase normally. To use uppercase, engage Caps Lock.

NOTES: You MUST delete your old WorldLis.MUD file, or Aliases can not be
appropriately tested. Shouldn't affect anything else, and I'm not sure how
your workaround of creating a default Alias list will help. It might be
enough. If you have any problems - start over from scratch.

FIXED:
-saving of window position.
-clicking macro button 1 fixed
-added support for control-P (prev), control-N (next), control-U (clear)
[Yes, I know Gmud already has up, down and esc, but they bug me ;) ]
-Internal fix - renamed the menu items to match their new positions
-Added "%%% Activity in window ..." display on activity (and config)
-Added toggle for the CLI
-Increased count in color bar dropdowns to 6 lines (by reducing the size of
the lines)
-Made the ugly separator bar a normal reasonable size
-Added ability to select a multi-line input mode
-Fixed the font setting in the input window
-Fixed shortcut keys alt+1, etc (which I broke)
-Fixed menu greying (it was greying out exit!)
-Fixed File->Exit
-Potentially fixed the Alias woes (there were nasty typos that got it mixed
up with the Trigger list - you *must* delete your WorldLis.MUD or it will
stay corrupted.)
-Tweaked control key handling to prevent sticking on missed messages
-Tough if you don't like the depressed buttons OR my artwork. ;)

TODO still:
-80/wrap to screen bug (reproduced)
-Move configuration and world list from INI to registry
-Add autolog feature

--
2/24/02
--
NOTES:
-Just a quick update before dinner ;)
-Now giving you release builds rather than debug builds (true of last build)

FIXED:
-Alias button is disabled when all windows are closed
-Added control-Up and control-Down for history (works in both modes)

TODO:
-Command Stacking
-Speed Walk (need description)
-Automatic logging
-Move config to registry
-Wrap to screen bug

--
2/25/02
--
NOTES:
-Still not quite ready for production use - continue to use it in it's own
folder. New installs need to be set up from scratch.
-All known bugs (or at least serious ones) are fixed.

FIXES:
-Added SpeedWalk as a command-line command (type /help)
-Command stacking is hard-coded to use ";", and can be enabled under
Options. (Disabled because it breaks, for example, winks ;)  )
-Macro keys were broken in last release - fixed now
-Wrap to screen fixed (*finally*)
-Colored system messages (must have ANSI color on)
-Fixed available colors to match what the system uses for ANSI (this may
cause it to lose your color settings if you set it to something slightly off
before, like I did).
-Fixed typing of ( and & (not sure if they were broken in the last release
or not)

TODO:
-Move configuration to Registry
-Add auto-logging feature per world
-Add ability of triggers to color lines of text
-Add ability to export MUD list to a text file
-Add ability to import text file of MUDs
-Add ability to import MUD list from GMud 1.9 config
-Add ability to import MUD list from SimpleMU config
-Add ability to import MUD list from MUSHclient config
(no intention of importing settings from these configs - just the name,
address and port. How many are done depends on how hard it ends up being.)

Minor update, a few things that were bugging me:

-The '%%% Activity in world ...' message is now correctly colored
-When going through the history, the cursor is moved to the END of the line
instead of staying at the beginning. ;)

I wouldn't normally bother with this notice, but this way I don't have to
say that I never told you. ;)

Work is dragging me down again, thus the slowdown. On the plus side, I
mostly fixed a serious issue today, I think. Depends what the test shows in
the morning. ;)

--
3/25/02
--
Finally did some work on it. Found some previously unknown bugs, and
added a few features I realized I needed ;)

WHAT'S NEW:
-Cursor at end of line when scrolling through history
-Alt-S will send text as well as Enter (I keep doing this from habit
with ICQ)
-Multiline defaults to ON
-All Configuration moved to Registry (Arg! What a pain this was!)
It's in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, so the
settings will be per user, not per machine.
-Changed Connected World List to take a single click instead of a
double to change world
-Added 'Save Settings' option under file
-Fixed form to add Aliases, Triggers and Macros (would not allow
adding of new sets)

TODO:
-Automatic logging per world
-Colored lines by trigger
-Export/Import World List (considering dropping this)
-Import GMud 1.9 World List (considering dropping this)
-Import SimpleMU World List (considering dropping this)
-Import MUSHclient World List (considering dropping this)
-Automatic connect on startup
-Automatic reconnect when disconnected
-Log storage configuration
-Button to browse log directory
-Wheel mouse support for scrollback

NOTES:
-Sorry, you will once again lose your old config. I promise this is
the last time, though - it's where I want it to be now, and will not
change any further. :) This configuration update was the big job -
and it was much bigger than I expected, too.

--
3/26/02
--
WHAT'S NEW:
-Automatic logging per world (append/create new)
-Colored text triggers!
-AutoReconnect
-AutoConnect (on one world only)
-Removed startup argument support (conflicts with autoconnect)

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Bugfix in saving user variables for the world
-Bugfix in handling overwrite/append of logs
-Fixed a memory leak I introduced last build

TODO:
-Need to strip ANSI out of logs
-Fix AutoConnect for more than one world (this one is frustrating!)
-Log storage configuration (defaults to C:\, but you can browse to
store logs anywhere)
-Button to browse log directory
-Wheel mouse support for scrollback
-MCP parsing
-FlipSide's Graphics (yes, finally close enough to put this on the
list)

REQUEST FOR COMMENTS:
-Would the logging be better if it were set to always append, and you
specify when to make a new file (ie: Each Connect, Once a Day,
Never)? I think I prefer that, but tell me if you agree.

NOTES:
-I saved the old version as 'flipterm.old.zip' at the same
path, in case you wanted to archive it.
-Dropped the import/export functions - they're just a lot more
trouble than they are worth

WHAT'S NEW:
-New Beta testers - hi! :) See the notes section below.
-Autolog now supports three modes for starting a new file:
            Always - A new file is opened every time the world is
connected
            Daily - A new file is opened the first time each day the
world is connected, and appended to after that
            Never - The auto-log file is always appended to
-Automatically offers to create a log directory in My Documents when
first run
-Detects when log folder is moved or deleted
-Menu option to select default logfile (and offers to update autologs
to match)
-Menu option and toolbar button to automatically browse the default
log folder
-When possible to do so safely, FlipTerm will add an association to
*.log files so that they open in the same application as *.txt files
(normally Notepad).
-Added basic support for the wheel on a wheel mouse

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Better error message when autolog is enabled for append mode, and
the same world is connected to more than once
-Removed leftover requirements for WORLDLIS.MUD file (wouldn't start
if missing)
-Encrypted connection string (I need to know whether this works for
everyone, and if it doesn't, what version of Windows?)
-Autoconnect can now handle as many mucks as you want to autoconnect
to
-Clipboard copy (highlighting text automatically copies it) now does
end of line correctly
-No longer writing system messages into the log (and no ANSI problems
in the text)
-Fixed bug where it would think it was logging even if an error
occurred that prevented it
-Crash bug if you pressed the log button with no world open

NOTES:
-This is obviously the LOG release!
-To install, just unzip the program to a convenient folder and run
FlipTerm.exe. No installation is required, however, you will need to
set up your worlds.
-Autolog is not compatible with opening the same world more than once
unless the mode is set to 'Always' open a new file. No harm will be
done if you try, you will simply be warned that the autolog can not
append when another window is already appending.
-You can always log manually and choose the filename, as well as
whether to append or overwrite, if appropriate. The above limitations
are only on automatic logging.
-Now requires Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher if on Windows 95 (which
I don't support anyway...)
-The purpose of the *.log association is to allow users who do not
have *.log files associated with anything to be able to simply
double-click on *.log files and read them normally. This association
is only checked the first time the program sets up the log directory,
and will only occur if: (1) *.log files currently have NO association
at all, and  (2) *.txt files DO have an association. The information
from the *.txt setup is copied to *.log - if the *.txt program is
changed after this, it should affect *.log as well.
-5 steps forward, 4 steps back. This version I've noticed two
possibly serious errors - dropping of output when scrolling quickly,
and number of macros/triggers growing as time goes on. If you notice
the drop, let me know. The macros/aliases/triggers problem I'll fix
next release (and provide a cleanup tool). I recommend not using them
until next release.

TODO:
-Fix dropping/corrupting of output during fast scroll
-Fix the new Trigger/Macro/Alias set every boot
-Provide a .reg file to clean up the Triggers/Macros/Aliases
-MCP parsing for graphics
-FlipSide's graphics themselves

--
3/29/02
--
WHAT'S NEW:
Nothing - just fixes.

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Crash bug - if a muck closed on a window you were not looking at,
the program would crash
-Width of text output to windows other than the one you were looking
at was wrong if the windows were maximized (whew)
-When you closed all the child windows, it was impossible to create a
new one
-The text format of the logs is now correct for windows (end of line
was messing up frequently)
-Size of the log overwrite/replace/cancel dialog box was increased to
allow longer pathnames

TODO:
-Need new icons - I think .. fell through on me. :/
-MCP parsing for graphics
-FlipSide's graphics themselves

NOTES:
-This version still includes the FlipTerm Registry Cleanup.exe. Use
it if you find you have multiple "default" sets of aliases, triggers
and macros.

--
3/30/02
--
We'll beat this thing yet! ;)

WHAT'S NEW:
-Timestamps in the logs when they're opened and closed
-Onscreen message when the log is closed by a disconnect (just to be
sure you've been told)
-MCP 2.1 negotiation including cords and multi-line

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Improved auto-log error messages to include the filename it's trying
to write
-Restricted trigger audio file dialog to WAV files
-Log filename and path selection dialogs would permit illegal paths
and filenames (if you are getting errors opening the log, please
reselect your default log folder and your log filenames in the new
version)
-Probable memory leak in the output routine

NOTES:
-This version still includes the FlipTerm Registry Cleanup.exe. Use
it if you find you have multiple "default" sets of aliases, triggers
and macros.
-The MCP code required re-writing the main display loop, so it's
possible we'll see new bugs on received data from mucks. I hope to
have caught them all.
-The TODO list has had the previously vague 'FlipSides graphics
themselves' expanded into the next series of steps. I'd like for this
stuff to be accepted by other mucks, someday, so I'm following an
existing spec and I'm going to document it all.
-The MCP code will not do much by itself - but if you want to see it
work, just connect to Furrymuck (furry.com 9999). You don't need to
log in. You'll see an extra system message before the title page that
says "%%% MCP Capability Established" FlipTerm has actually had a
little conversation with the server at that point, which essentially
tells it we don't support anything yet.

TODO:
-Still need new icons - volunteers?
-Document FlipTerm extension to MCP to allow MUF to do the
negotiation
-Document the plugin structure and interface
-Create skeleton .DLL for plugins so others can expand it
-Document the 3D graphical extension
-Write the graphical plugin
-Actually load and access the plugins
-MUF program for FlipSide to do the negotiation
-Copy the graphics to FlipSide

--
3/31/02
--
WHAT'S NEW:
-Directory structure for distribution laid out
-FlipTerm MCP handling document created
-FlipTerm Plugin document created
-Created skeleton "dummy plugin" DLL
-FlipTerm loads and processes the DLLs (look under 'help' to see a list)

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Minor modifications to the MCP negotiation sequence

NOTES:
-MCP is "MUD Client Protocol", for those who were wondering ;)
-If you still need the FlipTerm Registry Cleanup tool, just let me
know
-Unless something else goes wrong, or I need to change the way something 
works, FlipTerm itself is now complete (except I need new icons) and I've 
only the MUF  code and plugin left to write.
-I may still need to extend the plugin structure, though, so all the 
documentation here is as beta as the code. ;)
-Unzip to the same folder as usual - note that new folders will be created. 
You can safely delete the SRC folder and the Old Gmud Docs folder if you don't 
want to use up the disk space. :)

TODO:
-Icons!!
-Document the 3D graphical extension

4/1/02
--
WHAT'S NEW:
-Added support for ANSI reverse text
-Helper note when you copy and paste text for the first time - to tell you it's 
been copied. A message box will pop up and tell you it's been copied, and ask 
whether you want to see the reminder again.

WHAT'S FIXED:
-conflict between command-line commands /window and /w (speedwalk)
-improved memory handling by removing debug libraries (why they were forced into 
the release build, I dunno)
-Lots of fixes to color, hopefully to fix the dimming/redraw problem. See the notes
-Colored 'Bad Speedwalking character' message

TODO:
-Colored triggers are not working
-Icons?
-Document the 3D extension
-Write the 3D plugin
-MUF program for FlipSide to do the negotiation
-Copy the graphics to FlipSide

NOTES:
-Color presented a host of problems with being reliably set that finally led me to 
just redo the painting and ANSI parsing systems. The new system has the advantage 
of translating the colors only once, instead of constantly, so should draw the 
screen faster.
-The changes to the color system means that you will probably lose your color 
preferences - please just go set them again

--
4/1/02 again
--
WHAT'S NEW:
-Nothing, just an important bugfix

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Garbled text caused by the new paint routines - was caused by partial lines being 
pulled back OUT of the buffer and having the color codes added a second time. ;) 
I didn't notice that at 5am ;)

NOTES:
-The text should be working correctly now.

TODO:
-Colored triggers are not working
-Icons?

4/2/02
--
WHAT'S NEW:
-Sets default to word wrap instead of character wrap by default

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Removed unnecessary references to more unused forms
-Rewrote the text printing code to match my drawing code. Puh.
-Wrap to screen should no longer lose characters under the scroll bar 
(it's still possible, depending on your font, but far less likely)
-Colored triggers now work and tend to use the right color, too ;)
-Black text is legal (it wasn't before. Trust me.) 
-Minor rare crash bug in the dummy plugin fixed

NOTES:
-Seems my changes to the color code were further reaching than I could 
anticipate at 5am. On the other side, I'm pleased to say I've also 
rewritten the character output routine, and it's a lot cleaner and 
simpler as well, plus it seems to work.
-Some modifications were done to the color routine. It absolutely 
hates black text, but I've forced it in.
-I'm back to work now, so these frequent updates will become a little 
less frequent, I fear. Thanks for everyone's work, though, keep it up. :)

--
4/6/02
--
WHAT'S NEW:
-Oddly, I should be in bed. ;) But I feel fine, at least.

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Broken words in the middle of blocks of text, I think. 
-Text is only copied to the clipboard if it is actually highlighted 
(previously the clipboard was erased for pretty much any click)
-'New Window' will automatically bring up the World Connect dialog, 
too. Blank windows are kinda silly. ;)
-Disconnect button now asks if you're sure. This behaviour can 
optionally be overridden so that it doesn't have to ask every time
-If your default color is a bright version, and the muck requests 
that exact bright text, it will instead choose the dim text so that 
it stands out from your default, even if it's not quite correct. 
I can't properly test this, but the right solution is to use the 
'dim' text for default :)

NOTES:
-The broken words, I think it's all good now. It looks good from 
here, but eh, I never seem to hit the test cases everyone else gets. 
That's why I have you! ;)
-The color decisions come after a chat with Netolu. If you're 
currently using a 'bright' color for your default, try selecting the 
dimmer version for more correct color. I don't want to force the use 
of just the dim colors - but that's an easy option, too :) Technically, 
for proper color the settings should be a black background and 
medium-grey (dim white) text. But we're trying to be flexible :)

TODO:
-Icons.
-Document the 3D extension
-Write the 3D plugin
-MUF program for FlipSide to do the negotiation
-Copy the graphics to FlipSide
-Add Alt Up and Down history keys (this was oddly not quite 
straightforward)
-Add a way to configure the 'helper' dialogs, so they can be 
turned back on if desired
-Create proper 'do you want to disconnect?' dialog so we don't 
need to use 'cancel' to disable it (misleading)
-Add a way to adjust the relative brightnesses of the ANSI colors

--
7 Apr 02
--
WHAT'S NEW:
-Still nothing.

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Round 3 of the color battles, and it's doing what it's supposed 
to now, near as I can tell
-Added locking of the internal lists to hopefully correct the 
garbled text that Azima is seeing

NOTES:
-When you find a problem, please email me the best description of 
any problem you see that you can, and how I can reproduce it for myself 
if you know. Because I work on this only in between other things, and 
I only make it online when everything else is done, email guarantees 
I have something to go on when I'm ready. There's no guarantee our 
schedules will overlap for live talking, and you're not being picky! 
I need to know the problems so I can correct them before release.
-Anytime locks are involved, there's the possibility of a 'deadlock' 
stopping things dead. So let me know if it appears to freeze up and 
won't display new text. The locking is fairly simple, so I don't 
expect it, but just to warn you.

8 Apr 02
--
WHAT'S NEW:
-Worlds have a '7 bit' flag that strips out high characters. It 
defaults to ON to hide control codes, but may be optionally 
turned off
-'Force Ansi Reset', under options, forces the ANSI colors back 
to the default at the end of every line 
-Added 'Switches' to the options menu, replaces the list of 
switches under Options with a form, and adds a few new ones
-Now possible to set the command stacking character on the 
switches form
-Found and included the original README.TXT explaining why the 
author quit GMud and granting permission to reuse
-An icon. Heck with it. :)
-Alt + Up and Down arrows for input history

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Check to ensure the screen doesn't scroll unless SOMETHING was 
displayed (should stop the doubling up of lines)
-Proper disconnect dialog

NOTES:
-'high characters' are usually characters such as the ones with 
accent characters for non-english languages. Some mucks use 
them, or extensions to VT100 that we don't support. By hiding 
those characters we reduce 'noise' on those mucks. However, if 
you NEED them, simply uncheck the box on that world and they 
will be visible
-Discarded the color adjust... what I had in mind didn't strike 
me as being valuable enough to be worth the work I'd have to do
-I added the 'Force ANSI Reset' after being on a muck that didn't 
reset the ANSI codes correctly - after viewing a block of red text, 
for example, EVERYTHING afterwards was red. ;) This forces 
FlipTerm to reset the colors after every line. It's going to 
be a matter of taste whether you want that.
-That gets me caught up on the bugs and features again - 
plugin time?

WHAT'S FIXED:
-The broken menu :)

NOTES:
-Several of you reported the broken menus in several different

WHAT'S NEW:
I think nothing, since I did three releases yesterday. ;)

WHAT'S FIXED:
-The scrolling issues, hopefully. Redid the system for 
determining when to scroll and when to wait. ;) Hope this 
helps, Nef. :)
-Cleaned up the tab order on the connection dialog and 
removed the 'static' label that wasn't supposed to be there ;)
-Fixed another crash bug in the dummy plugin 
(not sure how it ever worked! :) )

NOTES:
-Pause bug was a feature! ;)
-Input window now limited to 10k, shouldn't crash on HUGE 
pastes. ;)
-Remember you can always read the flipterm.txt file for 
all the previous release notes, if you forget how something 
works ;)

Very little for bug reports, that's probably either a good 
sign, or a very disturbing calm before the storm. ;)

WHAT'S NEW:
-Connect timer in status bar
-Line counter in status bar
-Input window is now sizable (in multi-line input mode)
-System message when pausing output

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Removed some more unused code/classes from the source

NOTES:
-The sizing of the input window is a little hacky - the code 
doesn't use proper framed windows. But, I think my workaround 
for that is working pretty well. Note that the input window 
size is a global setting and will be used for all newly 
opened windows.
-Did some work on Telnet negotiation - that's a lot trickier 
than I expected. Not sure whether I'll proceed with it. It's 
not like this is a common tool for connecting to Unix shells. ;)

WHAT'S NEW:
-Paused windows no longer scroll automatically upon release
-Added 'MORE' indicator to the status bar (note the clock, 
line count and more prompt only update once per second)
-Added numbered Window selection toolbar
-[VERY] basic Telnet negotiation - see notes

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Still more code simplification and cleanup
-Receiving of packets containing multiple strings (probably 
only under telnet)
-Fixed a problem preventing settings from being saved (caused 
by the connect timer, surprisingly ;) )

NOTES:
-The Stan-Compliant Pause Functionality is now in Effect
-The 'more' indicator in the bottom status line will light up 
any time you are not at the bottom of the buffer - scroll 
down :)
-The new numbered window selection bar provides shortcuts to 
the first 9 windows, mapping directly to the keys alt+1-9.
(Alt-0 opens a Window selection dialog). These numbers go red 
when there is pending activity in that window. As with all
the toolbars, this window may be dragged about and even 
undocked from FlipTerm. 
-The telnet negotiation is not intended to be anything overly 
practical - using a Unix shell from FlipTerm, for example, is 
an amusing example of silliness. The main point was that I saw 
too many clients bleating about how GMud doesn't do any 
negotiation and they do. FlipTerm negotiates - it's enough to 
log in, but we basically tell the other end that we don't 
support anything it asks us about. (Net: it turns out this is 
the funky codes that Red Dragon sends at login, except for the 
^L. I still can't explain that.) For what it's worth, my problems 
with it last night were due to 2:30am syndrome when nothing 
makes sense.) Anyway, please do not submit bugs on the telnet 
support - it's at the bottom of my interest level. ;)
-Calling it an early night at 12:45 for a change. ;)

WHAT'S NEW:
-'Default System Colors' under options will allow you to 
remap the 16 colors used by FlipTerm to anything your 
system supports. This is for those who don't care for 
the fully-saturated colormap :)

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Scroll range on the scroll bar - should work for more 
than 500 lines now 
-Reworked the Trigger dialog - see Notes
-More unused code removal/cleanup

NOTES:
-The trigger dialog now functions more like the world 
dialog - you click 'add', you get prompted for the 
trigger text, and then you edit it. It greys out the 
controls when no trigger is selected, and should be 
self-explanatory now. It also confirms deletes, which 
is new behaviour.

WHAT'S NEW:
-'Default Color' dialog now loads the current colors into 
the custom color portion of the color picker. It's a 
minor thing. ;)
-Ability to set custom colors and font for each world. 
Major thing. ;)
-The names of the options in the options menu have 
been changed and moved

WHAT'S FIXED:
-'Create Autolog' selections on World dialog - 
'Never' no longer sticks on.
-Double-spacing as displayed by some mucks was 
being ignored - should work now.
-More code cleanup!

NOTES:
-The custom color/font selection still recognizes the concept 
of a universal 'default'. When set to 'default', the color 
and font information is read from the global settings, 
otherwise the world settings will override it. Color and 
Font are separate settings, and one may be set to custom 
while the other is still default. Custom color settings are 
indicated by an asterix (*) on the color change button on 
the connect form. Custom font settings will display the 
font name, or the word 'Default'.
-This color/font customization touched large portions of the 
code, so there's a reasonably good chance for new bugs. I 
don't *want* any, but if you see them, lemme know. ;)
-If only because the World form is so crowded already, and 
nobody has actually requested it, I'm going to drop the 
ability to set the switches independantly on the worlds as 
well. I think the number of switches for which it's valuable 
is fairly limited and for the most part, everyone runs the 
same settings everywhere. Correct me if I'm wrong very 
soon, cause I want this sucker done. ;)

corrected
-Fixed another end of line bug - looks much better now

NOTES:
-Netolu is such a troublemaker - always finding

WHAT'S NEW:
-When you manually turn on the log, it will ask whether you'd 
like to log all the way back to the beginning of the buffer. 
Handy if you turn it on after the session has already started. 
Azima requested, but I'd had it in mind anyway. ;)

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Positioning bug when resizing the input window - it shifted 
things over a pixel or three. Thank Netolu's sharp eyes for 
that catch.

NOTES:
-Guess that's about it? Good! Client seems nice and stable, 
and so does the dummy plug in. Now I can finally build on it.

Please *READ* the notes on this one. :) Especially if you 
wanted your autolog filenames to include the date. ;)

RELEASE: 27 Apr 02 - 2:16am

WHAT'S NEW:
-Modified the naming scheme for autolog. You may now enter 
special characters to indicate parts of the current date 
and time for the log name. See the notes.
-Added a new switch to disable the way the connect dialog 
automatically appears when you open a new window
-Added another new switch to change the review buffer - 
when you turn it off, it leaves the cursor at the beginning 
of the text instead of jumping to the end (classic GMud 
behaviour)
-Added 'Output Resumed' message when un-pausing
-Added ability to change the color of System messages
-Added three new shortcut buttons - Switches, System Message 
Color, Global System Colors
-Fonts can now save the weight (ie: bold) and Italic settings
-Added build date and time to the About box.

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Obscure window change bug in the connected world list - if 
you selected the window that was currently open (for instance, 
double- or triple-clicking), then hit space, the next window 
in the list would be selected. Fixed so that focus always 
returns to the main window.
-Sizing bug - if you had the form maximized, then closed all 
world windows, then opened a new one, the window would resize 
incorrectly. Fixed that.
-Plugin help - didn't work with more than one plugin. Fixed.
-Control key sometimes was not cleared when changing focus 
(so it thought it was still pressed)
-Improved the descriptions on the switches dialog
-Crash bug - if a line was longer than the width of the 
output window (or longer than 80 columns with 80 wrap on) 
which can not be word-wrapped, and there was a space in the 
line BEFORE the excessively long part, it would get stuck in 
a loop and scroll forever.
-Added shortcut keys to all three buttons on the Overwrite/
Append/Cancel form
-Mousewheel scrolling - minimized the line 'stretching'. Nearly 
everyone complained, so I did it a different way. Seems to 
work better, though it's not quite so smooth. ;)
-Fixed a bug that gave incorrect results when using non-default 
fonts per world
-Autolog remembers the last filename used - so if you turn it 
off, then turn it on again, it remembers the old name
-Changed AutoReconnect to autoreconnect only if an error caused 
the connection to abort (ie: lagged out)

NOTES:
-Possible fix - not sure what was really broken - I noticed 
a case where the output could get out of sync - ie: you'd 
type a line, but the line you typed three or four lines 
ago is the one that gets sent. I modified the logic in 
the send function a bit to make sure it sends as much as 
possible, instead of just one line - that way if it falls 
behind, it can catch up. The original author hinted in his 
notes that he had seen this, too, but he blamed an old 
version of Windows NT. ;) I noticed it with command stacking, 
since that puts a load on the send function. Anyway, I think 
it's fixed. if you notice any problems sending text, let me 
know. If it happens, just close the window and open a new 
one, that will clear things out and not affect the rest of 
your windows. :)
-Autolog - The original naming sequence took whatever you 
entered for the name, and adding a number to it that always 
increased. This method is still used with normal filename, 
except there is now an underscore (_) separating the name 
and the number. The new system, and perhaps more interesting, 
lets you enter the current date as part of the filename. 
To embed part of the date, enter "%x", where 'x' is a letter 
that indicates what you are interested in. Slashes (/) and 
colons (:), which are common in dates but illegal in filenames, 
are converted automatically to dashes (-) and periods (.). 
I'll give a few examples here. ;) Hold onto this list for 
reference if you want to use this feature. Note that it 
matters if it's uppercase or lowercase! 
%a - Abbreviated weekday name (Mon, Tue, Wed)
%A - full weekday name (Monday, Tuesday Wednesday)
%b - Abbreviated month name (Jan, Feb, Mar)
%B - full month name (January, February, March)
%c - current date and time (depends on your system settings - 
I get '04-26-02 20.50.35' (date/time) )
%#c - *long* date and time representation (ie: Friday, April 
26, 2002, 20.59.15)
%d - day of month (01 - 31)
%H - 24-hr formatted hour (00-23)
%I - 12-hr formatted hour (01-12)
%j - day of year by number (001 - 366)
%m - month by number (01 - 12)
%M - Minute (00 - 59)
%p - A.M./P.M. indicator
%S - Seconds (00 - 59)
%U - Week of year (Sunday is first day of week, 00 - 53)
%w - Weekday by number (0 - 6, Sunday is 0)
%W - Week of year (Monday is first day of week, 00 - 53)
%x - Date representation (depends on your settings, I get 
04-26-02)
%#x - *long* date representation, as with %#c
%X - Time representation (depends on your settings, I get 
20.56.25)
%y - Year without century (00 - 99)
%Y - Year with century (ie: 2002)
%z or %Z - Time zone name or abbreviation (depends on 
system settings and zone, I get the full words 'Pacific 
Daylight Time')
You can also remove leading zeros, if any, on the following 
codes by adding a # sign (So that '09' reads instead as '9'):
%#d, %#H, %#I, %#j, %#m, %#M, %#S, %#U, %#w, %#W, %#y, %#Y

-I did some investigation as to speeding up the paint/scroll 
routine. There's quite honestly a lot of stuff going on in 
there. My code is substantially simpler than the original 
code, but I have to admit it's doing a lot more work. I've 
made some minor tweaks, but I suspect that the tradeoff is 
going to become speed vs maintainability, and I'd rather have 
the latter than scroll 5 pages in half a second instead of 
two. Some day in the distant future I may revisit that, but 
right now, this code works, is solid, and I'd like to leave 
it as is. 
-The autoreconnect change came about after someone noted to 
me that when they typed 'QUIT', it reconnected to the muck. 
So I changed it to autoreconnect only if an error occurred, 
never on a clean disconnect (ie: either you or the server 
disconnected on purpose). Question: is this preferable? I know 
some people like this kind of feature to defeat mucks that 
idle you out. I personally very much dislike that behaviour, 
but you are all my test bed. Give me feedback on this question. 
Should it always reconnect, or only when an error occurs?

RELEASE:28 Apr 02 - 1:53am

WHAT'S NEW:
Nothing

WHAT'S FIXED:
-If a long is longer than the wrap width but never contains 
any spaces, it would spin forever on it 
-Word wrap was broken in the last release. I knuckled down, 
stopped trying to be fancy, and added a couple more checks. 
-Changed the selection function so that if you don't actually 
select any text, it doesn't clear out the clipboard
-Fixed potential case in the selection code where it would 
stay paused (without telling you) when you clicked the screen
-Fixed bug (I think) where using different fonts in different 
windows would cause the wordwrap in background windows to 
mess up (I think) ;)

NOTES:
-Word-Wrap should work now. I've run it as narrow as 15 
columns wide. I've tested with GIMONGOUS fonts. I've tested 
with ittsybitsyteenyweenyfonts. I've squashed my window and 
stretched it across both monitors.

RELEASE:9 Jun 02 - 2:21pm

WHAT'S NEW:
-Updated plugin format so that plugins can process 
strings of text as well as MCP commands. Still 
version 1.0 as we haven't released yet.
-Added speech plugin to read the screen for you. 
It's kind of preliminary and not installed by default - 
copy it to the plugins folder to try it. See the notes.
-Added 'Swedish Chef' plugin. It's fun and silly and 
hard to read. ;)

WHAT'S FIXED:
-When a punctuation mark was the last character on a 
line, only the punctuation would wrap. Fixed.
-Command stacking was always on with '|', regardless 
of the switch settings. Now pays attention.
-MCP - when 20 bad keys are received, if you choose 
not to disable MCP, it will reset the counter.
-Plugins that report a low version of 0 (invalid) are 
not negotiated with the server (this permits text-only 
plugins like Speech and Chef)

WHAT'S WORKED ON:
-The odd line breaks in the logs. It's pretty hard 
for me to reproduce.
-Updated the plugin structure to allow more 
flexibility in the DLLs

NOTES:
-I don't recommend the speech plugin for serious use. 
It's main problem (besides keeping up) is that once 
it's loaded, you can't UNLOAD it. You close FlipTerm, 
but it's still there in the background. Until I solve 
that, it's just a toy. Therefore, it is not in the 
'plugins' directory by default.
-If you do decide to play with it, you may need 
Microsoft's speech libraries. They are installed by 
default in XP but not in anything earlier (I think). 
See http://www.microsoft.com/speech/. I think you may 
need to install the entire Speech SDK (68mb), as I 
can't find a download that installs just the libraries. 
(Perhaps they expect the developer to include them.. 
that would be the redistributables. I don't, at least 
not right now.) Anyway, I'm not sure what the 
requirements are. 
-The 3D plugin is now included, but it doesn't do 
anything yet. Like the Plugin Skeleton, it just 
sits there.
-Swedish Chef (remember the muppets?) is a silly 
sample plugin that makes everything look like the 
Swedish Chef said it. Click Help->Swedish Chef to 
turn it on and off. (It defaults to off).
-Nobody gave me feedback on the Reconnect feature 
changes, so it's staying as-is. ;)

TODO:
Well, the work with the text-based plugins suggested 
there is a bit left to do:
-Text-based plugins that return strings (ie: Chef) 
remove all color from the string - they should get 
the color and handle it themselves.
-'rainbow text' plugin to demonstrate the color handling
-Need a dialog to enable/disable and configure plugins
-Plugins need to be configurable
-Document the 3D extension
-Document the color handling system for plugin authors
-Complete the 3D plugin (needs everything)
-Complete the Speech plugin (needs ability to stop 
voice, and needs to actually exit on close)

RELEASE: 7 Jul 02 - 20:39

WHAT'S NEW:
-Built with latest version of the Microsoft Platform SDK
-The 'Show Activity' switch will also flash the title bar 
if activity occurs while another program is active (I found 
I'd been forgetting I had the muck window open ;) )
-Added a copy of MyAnsiNext() to the plugin skeleton to 
help parse ANSI codes
-Plugins are announced as they load on startup
-Added separate menu item for Plugins

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Activity indicator now says 'Activity in world..' instead 
of 'Activity in window...' (to match the documentation)
-The quick-select number bar - if you closed a window while 
another window showed activity, it would sometimes leave the 
red number up for a window that no longer exists. Fixed that.
-Text-only plugins now receive the full original ANSI string, 
so be aware of that when parsing text

NOTES:
-I've fought the speech plugin some more, and just given up 
on it - I can't get it to exit. I'll include the source 
code but it's not supported.

RELEASE: 9 Aug 02 1:17

WHAT'S NEW:
-Added a new MCP (optional) command to the plugins
-Real work done on the 3D Plugin - it does stuff now
-MUF program to do initial negotiation

WHAT'S FIXED:
-I've honestly lost track, but I think very little

NOTES:
-The new MCP command is #$#mcp-internal, used for passing messages between the plugin and FlipTerm only. It has a single required argument, 'type', which contains a string. Currently the only defined type is 'focus', which is sent when the active window changes. All plugins always receive mcp-internal messages, even if you return true (that you processed it). However, continue to indicate whether you processed the message for future compatibility.
-Currently the 3D plugin only has the functionality of the original demo. It can't save any settings, and the zoom doesn't work. But you can load a file and scroll around in it, and FlipTerm correctly communicates with it when to start and stop (and set the title bar, partially)
-To use the 3D plugin, right-click on it's window, then from the file selector, select one of the included JPGs. I've included 3 randomly selected pics from El Dogrado. To 'look around', hold the left mouse button on the window, and move the mouse. You can change the picture again by right-clicking again. And yes, any JPG will load, but may not look that good. ;)
-The source for the 3D plugin still uses ImgSource, which I can't distribute the key for. I'll try to fix that before the real release.
-MCP is only enabled at FlipSide if you connect while in the Crossroads, so to see the plugin you'll need to be in there.
-The MUF may be slightly less useful outside of FlipSide than hoped - I had to modify FuzzBall slightly to permit it to work
-The rush is on, we want to launch this for FlipSide's Open House, which starts September 1 or so. :) So the entire TODO list may not get done

TODO:
-3D Plugin must be configurable
-3D Plugin must receive commands for image loading from FlipSide
-3D Plugin must be able to download images (probable future)

RELEASE: 14 Aug 02 - 11:51pm

WHAT'S NEW:
-New Installer! Please see the Notes!
-3d Plugin now has a 'reset' button to reposition all views to the
default location
-3d Plugin window text parameter changed from 'World' to 'Tag'
-3d plugin supports HTTP downloading and automatic image updates

WHAT'S FIXED:
-3d Plugin was saving it's configuration in the wrong registry tree
(HKLM vs HKCU)
-Updated plugin notes to specify which registry tree to use
-Default path for the 3D plugin is now current folder, not my test
path ;)
-Clarification of the message when the 3d plugin can't find it's
config
-Installer now sets default for 3d Plugin, so these shouldn't be an
issue anyway
-3D view windows remember where they were last at, based on the muck
world name
-Fixed handle leak in 3D view configuration
-3D Window repositions when it's size is changed
-3D Plugin configuration form stays on top of the main form until
closed

NOTES:
-FlipTerm is now shipped as a single self-installing executable -
simply run InstallFlipTerm.exe and follow the prompts. This installer
is created by NullSoft, the makers of WinAmp, and is nicely licensed
to be completely free. It more than fits our needs, and is very
reliable.
-PLEASE DELETE YOUR OLD FLIPTERM FOLDER BEFORE
INSTALLING THE NEW ONE. Your settings in the registry
will be preserved, however, you do not need ANY of the old files.
(NOTE: if you have Logs in the FlipTerm folder, you might want
to save those. ;) Please check what you're deleting.)
-The installer will auto configure the tricky stuff like the plugins
and paths, so it should be plug and play. Your old settings in the
registry WILL be saved, except for the 3d plugin due to the bug
mentioned above. (But if you do a default install, that won't
matter.)
-The installer also gives us nice UNinstall support, which will
let you completely wipe your system of FlipTerm. Note, the
uninstaller (Add/Remove Programs, or the Uninstall shortcut)
*WILL* delete all your settings, including worlds! So test it
only if you mean it. ;)
-You do not have to install everything. As my testers, I ask that you
please install at least the main program and the plugins. Everything
else is optional. :)
-I spent *substantial* time on checking out the issue of broken lines
in the log files. To the best that I could determine, logging is now
working properly for live logs. If you log after starting a session,
and say 'yes' to "would you like to log back to the beginning of the
buffer?', the old lines copied to the log file will be formatted to
the width they are onscreen, and therefore may look poorly formatted
in the log. Fixing this is going to have to be part of a larger
overhaul of the buffer system. However, everything logged AFTER you
turn on logging should be *fine*. If it's not, please help me work
out under what circumstances it's not. :)

TODO:
-Abort a current download if a new one is started
-Set the correct tag on the window after a download

RELEASE: 18 Aug 02 9:12pm

WHAT'S NEW:
-Release Candidate 1

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Installer minor text changes
-3DView Aborts a download if a new one is started before the last one ends
-3DView Image is remembered when window is resized or reset, and will re-open the picture
-3DView When window is closed, the image will not be downloaded but will be remembered
-3DView Improved parsing of URLs and Filenames
-3DView Background downloads do not interfere with the window
-3DView Window tag is correctly set after a download
-3DView buffer overrun in the window title corrected
-3DView memory leak and possible hang if download thread failed to start
-Main program - potential fix for fragmented MCP commands (I can't get it to happen now! ;) )

NOTES:
-If you downloaded the previous version with installer, just install this one over top, do not uninstall. Otherwise, follow the instructions in the last email (delete your current FlipTerm folder, then run the installer).

WHAT'S NEW:
-Nothing

WHAT'S FIXED:
-Split line fix didn't work (thanks Sarabi)
-3D Plugin failed to check for trailing \ on path (wouldn't load NULL.jpg) (thanks Netolu)
-3D Plugin did not create download folders (so nothing could download) (thanks Netolu)

NOTES:
-You can work around both problems (and indeed, you might not have seen them). For the first, under the plugin setup, make sure that the path ends with a backslash (\). For the second, browse to the image cache (where NULL.jpg is), and create an empty folder named 'FlipSide'.
-Cache folder creation is not recursive - images must be nested only 1 folder deep. Documentation updated to reflect this.
